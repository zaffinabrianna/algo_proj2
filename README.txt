Brianna Zaffina & Suanna Shih readme:

To perform our code, follow these steps:
1. Upload all three of our files into your IDE (main.cpp, vibeCheck.h, (Suanna's code)) or open the directory
of the files (depending on your IDE).
2. Run the Code

Algorithm 1 Expected Output:
Which Algorithm do you want to test? Enter the number. (1 or 2)
1
Algorithm 1 Test:
Test 1:
3 -1 0 1
2 2 1 -1
1 -1 2 -1
0 -1 3 4

Test 2:
0 1 2
1 -1 1
2 1 0

Algorithm 2 Expected Output:
Which Algorithm do you want to test? Enter the number. (1 or 2)
2
Algorithm 2 Test:
First Test [1, 2, 3, 6, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8]:
Your group is valid!

Second Test [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]:
Your group is invalid, it does not increase by 1 consecutively.

Third Test (Group Size 5) [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]:
Your group is not valid, cannot be divided into even groups

Fourth Test [1, 3, 6, 2, 4, 2, 3, 8, 7]:
Your group is valid!

Boom! You're finished. main.cpp should compile test cases for all the requirements.
If you would like to add more test cases:

For Algorithm1:
	Inside main.cpp, add your test cases inside the "case 1" of the switch statement

For Algorithm2:
	Inside main.cpp, add your test cases inside the "case 2" of the switch statement
